I am a computer science graduate student (M.Sc.) at Tel Aviv University, focusing on machine learning and NLP. I have 3
years of practical R&D experience in deep learning and data science. Prior to that, I graduated from the elite academic and
leadership program Talpiot.
With my skills and interests, I am excited to contribute to the discovery of elegant answers to the most important questions
in science and to be a part of building groundbreaking technologies.
