I am a graduate of the [Talpiot program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talpiot_program) with a B.Sc. in Physics and Computer Science, and an M.Sc. in Computer Science from Tel Aviv University. My experience includes 4 years of R&D in machine learning, with a focus on deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and data science.

Currently, I work as an Algorithm Developer at [AI21 Labs](https://www.ai21.com/), developing innovative NLP products.

Driven by curiosity, I am passionate about leveraging my interdisciplinary background to tackle complex challenges and advance science and technology.
