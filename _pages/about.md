I am a recent M.Sc. graduate in Computer Science from Tel Aviv University, where I specialized in machine learning and NLP. Currently, at AI21 Labs, I am an Algorithm Developer, primarily engaged in researching and developing innovative NLP products. I bring over 3 years of R&D experience in deep learning, computer vision, and data science to my role. I completed my bachelor's degree as part of my participation in the prestigious Talpiot program, which significantly enhanced my leadership and technical skills. My dedication to AI drives me to solve complex challenges and contribute to the advancement of this dynamic field.
